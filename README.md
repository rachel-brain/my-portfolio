# my-portfolio
BOOTCAMP - Week 2 assignment

<!-- REWORK THE README FOLLOWING THESE DIRECTIONS -->

## User Story

```
AS A upcoming web developer
I WANT to showcase my portfolio of deployed work samples
SO THAT I can present the best examples of my work so a potential employer can assess whether I am a good candidate for a position they have available
```

## Description
My motivation for undertaking this project was to have a portfolio ready to go, once required, which I can add to as I progress in my web development experience. It is to use as an adjunct to my resume, giving me the ability to present the best examples of my coding work. It was also a good chance to learn various css methods, especially internal links & flexbox containers. I also drafted a wireframe prior to building the code which can be seen in the assets at (assets/images/my-portfolio-wireframe.png).

## Installation
Open the index.html page in your prefered browser to see the finished webpage which is responsive so can be viewed on a number of different screen sizes.

## Usage
* Click on the images to be directed to the top of the page.  Note that, in this case, the top of the page has been used as a placeholder for when I add further work; in which case, clicking on the images will direct the user to the new work.

## Screenshot
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Tests
The main test run was to look at the site in multiple screen sizes, using the toggle device bar in the Dev Tools in the browser.  Unfortunately, at time of publishing, the site was not perfect in all screen sizes & further debugging is required.
